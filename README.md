# WaterEntrySHO

This repository complements the article at (ADD LINK). Trial-averaged slamming phase impact acceleration versus time profiles are provided for the water entry of a simple harmonic oscillator with various impact velocities (V), spring stiffness values (k), nose mass ratios (alpha) and nose radii (R).
